# Decision Theory

This is a brief introduction to some aspects of Decision Theory that I'm interested in. You can view the actual site at https://mogar.github.io/DecisionTheory/

All the content on the site is written by me unless otherwise noted. That means all the mistakes are mine too.

I've read a bunch about the topic, but I'm just an amateur. I also don't necesarrily have notes and sources for everything I've learned, so lmk if you think something should be referenced better.

PRs welcome if you see something that should be fixed/improved/added.

## TODO

* page footer with links here and for contact
* more problems
* flesh out CDT with do-operator stuff

## Site Details

This site is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and the [just-the-docs](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/) theme.
