## Decision Theory

Decision Theory is an area of study focused on how people choose actions that give them high reward in various situations. It's technically a superset of game-theory and social-choice theory.

Often, the study of decision theory is focused on questions where people have intuitive disagreements about the best course of action, even after fully understanding the Nash equilibria and game dynamics. These intuitive disagreements are often based on differing ideas about what a deciding agent can control or influence.

The study of decision theory has two main components: problems and theories. Problems are questions in which an optimal decision is desired. Theories are specific ways of making decisions given the details of a problem. The holy grail here is a decision theory that always gives you a good answer, regardless of what problem you apply it to.

Unfortunately, all decision theories have been shown to give poor answers for various problems. Decision theory researchers often try to come up with new theories that can't be taken advantage of, or new problems that show how some specific theory can be defeated.
