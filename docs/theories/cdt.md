## Causal Decision Theory

Causal Decision Theory takes the perspective that the only things that matter in a decision problem are what the decider can causally impact. Anything that happened in the past isn't worth worrying about, since it can't be changed now. Anything that someone else will do without knowledge of what the decider does is also considered to be uninfluenceable, since there's no causal path from the decider to the other agent.
