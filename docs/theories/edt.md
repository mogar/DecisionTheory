# Evidential Decision Theory

Evidential Decision Theory takes the perspective that the only things that matter in a decision problem are what the decision gives you evidence of. 

More formally, EDT-using agents will calculate expected payoffs [using conditional probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidential_decision_theory). In words, they would reason "given that I make this decision, what is the expected payoff going to be." This is very different from CDT, as it allows non-causal correlations to impact the final choice.

## Algorithmic EDT

In order to make a decision using EDT, you need to know all of the conditional probabilities (the correlations) between the variables in the problem. For standard DT problems, these are given in the problem statement. In the real world, finding these correlations has been the main effort of many sciences for the past hundred years or so. EDT is a good fit for the classical statistics view of science.

Once you have all the relevant conditional probabilities, you can calculate outcomes
