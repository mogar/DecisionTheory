# Decision Theories

Decision theories define:

1. how to choose an action
2. given the situation you face
3. in order to get what you value

Note that the theories don't define what you value. Often the value of various outcomes is given explicitly in the decision problem to avoid confusion. For example, you might be told that one player values their life at $100 and values their dinner at $10. The idea is that you take these values as given in the game, even if they don't really make sense for a real person.

One thing decision theories do define is how to predict the outcomes of decisions. They don't get to say how the world actually does evolve, but they do say how the player thinks it will evolve. Popular decision theories all make predictions about how the world changes that make sense in context, but predictions of different theories can diverge in weird situations. Decision theory problems often focus on those weird situations in order to emphasize the differences between decision theories.
